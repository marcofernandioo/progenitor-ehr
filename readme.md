# Requirements
- NodeJS version 16

# How to Run the Code
- Once you have extracted the files, , open the terminal and cd into the root directory of this project, and run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies. Depending on your computer, it takes some time. If you have installed successfully, there shouldn't be any error messages.
- After installation, then you should run `npm run start` to run the blockchain node server. If there's no error, the node server should display that it is served through localhost port 8000, and later connect to the database.
- If after you've run `npm run start` and it says some module is missing, you can do `npm i module-name`. Very unlikely to happen.

# Additional Details
- Make sure you run this server BEFORE running the client.
